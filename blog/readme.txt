This is a default setup for a webapplication, using the Konstrukt framework. 

You can copy the contents to a new location, to create a new web application. To make it reachable through a web server, you'll have to configure Apache (Currently the only server supported) to serve from the www folder.

This setup is meant as a quick startingpoint, to get a new application up and running. If you don't like the directory layout or some of the dependency choices (Eg. Bucket and php-templates), feel free to change them; Theese are just some suggestions.

The following dependencies are required:
  Konstrukt, version 2 (http://konstrukt.googlecode.com/svn/trunk)
  Simpletest (http://simpletest.org/en/download.html)
  Bucket (http://github.com/troelskn/bucket/tree/master)
